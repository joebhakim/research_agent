Mental Health Treatment Among Children 
Aged 5–17 Years: United States, 2021
Benjamin Zablotsky, Ph.D., and Amanda E. Ng, M.P.H.
Key findings
Data from the National 
Health Interview Survey
 ● Children aged 12–17 years 
were more likely to have 
received any mental health 
treatment (including having 
taken prescription medication 
and received counseling or 
therapy from a mental health 
professional) in the past 12 
months (18.9%) compared 
with children aged 5–11 
years (11.3%).
 ● Boys were more likely than 
girls to have taken prescription 
medication for their mental 
health in the past 12 months 
(9.0% and 7.3%, respectively).
 ● Asian non-Hispanic 
children were least likely to 
have received any mental 
health treatment in the past 
12 months compared with 
children in other race and 
Hispanic-origin groups. 
 ● As the level of urbanization 
decreased, the percentage 
of children who received 
any mental health treatment 
increased.
Mental health disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 
anxiety, and behavioral conditions, are common in school-aged children in 
the United States (1). Frontline treatments for mental health disorders can 
include medication, counseling or therapy, or both, depending on the condition 
and the age of the child (2). This report describes the percentage of children 
aged 5–17 years who have received mental health treatment in the past 12 
months by selected characteristics, based on data from the 2021 National 
Health Interview Survey. Mental health treatment is defined as having taken 
medication for mental health, received counseling or therapy from a mental 
health professional, or both in the past 12 months.
Older children were more likely than younger children to 
have received any mental health treatment.

The percentage of children who had received any mental health treatment 
was lowest among Asian non-Hispanic children. 
 ● In 2021, Asian non-Hispanic children (subsequently, Asian; 4.4%) were less likely 
than Hispanic (10.3%), Black non-Hispanic (subsequently, Black; 12.5%), and White 
non-Hispanic (subsequently, White; 18.3%) children to have received any mental health 
treatment (Figure 3).

The percentage of children who had received any mental health treatment 
varied by urbanization level.
 ● In 2021, the percentage of children who had received any mental health treatment in the 
past 12 months increased as the place of residence became more rural, from 14.0% in 
large metropolitan areas to 14.9% in medium or small metropolitan areas and 19.1% in 
nonmetropolitan areas (Figure 4).
 ● The percentage of children who had taken medication for their mental health in the past 
12 months also increased with rurality, from 7.1% in large metropolitan areas to 8.5% in 
medium or small metropolitan areas and 12.1% in nonmetropolitan areas.
 ● The percentage of children who received counseling or therapy from a mental health 
professional in the past 12 months was similar in large metropolitan (11.5%), medium or 
small metropolitan (11.0%), and nonmetropolitan (13.0%) areas.

Summary
In 2021, 14.9% of children aged 5–17 years in the United States received mental health treatment 
in the past 12 months. About 8% of children took prescription medication for their mental health, 
and 11.5% of children received counseling or therapy from a mental health professional.
Several differences in the prevalence of mental health treatment among school-aged children were 
consistent with a previous National Center for Health Statistics report (3) by age group, sex, race 
and Hispanic origin, and urbanization level. Older children (aged 12–17 years) remained more 
likely than younger children (aged 5–11 years) to have received any mental health treatment, 
and boys remained more likely than girls to have taken prescription medication for their mental 
health. White children remained the most likely to have received any mental health treatment, 
while Asian children were the least likely. The percentage of children who had taken medication 
for their mental health continued to increase as urbanization decreased, while the percentage of 
children who had received counseling or therapy did not differ by urbanization level, a finding 
supported in other surveillance efforts (1). 
Definitions
Any mental health treatment, past 12 months: A composite measure of children who were 
reported to have taken medication for their mental health, received counseling or therapy from a 
mental health professional, or both in the past 12 months. 
Race and Hispanic origin: Children categorized as non-Hispanic indicated one race only; 
respondents had the option to select more than one racial group. Children categorized as Hispanic 
may be of any race or combination of races. Estimates for non-Hispanic children of races other 
than Asian, Black, or White are not shown but are included in total estimates. Analyses were 
limited to the race and Hispanic-origin groups for which data were reliable and sufficiently 
powered for group comparisons. 
Received therapy or counseling, past 12 months: Based on a “yes” response to the survey 
question, “During the past 12 months, did [child’s name] receive counseling or therapy from 
a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse, or clinical 
social worker?”
Taking medication for mental health, past 12 months: Based on a “yes” response to the survey 
question, “During the past 12 months, did [child’s name] take any prescription medication to help 
with [his/her] emotions, concentration, behavior, or mental health?” 
Urbanization level: Metropolitan size and status were determined using the 2013 National 
Center for Health Statistics urban–rural classification scheme for counties (4), by merging the 
geographic federal information processing standard codes for the county of household residence 
with the county-level federal information processing standard codes from the classification 
scheme’s data set. Large metropolitan includes large central and large fringe metropolitan 
counties. Medium or small metropolitan includes medium and small metropolitan counties. 
Nonmetropolitan includes micropolitan and noncore counties.

Data source and methods
Data from the 2021 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were used for this analysis. 
NHIS is a nationally representative household survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized 
population. It is conducted continuously throughout the year by the National Center for Health 
Statistics. Interviews are typically conducted in respondents’ homes, but follow-ups to complete 
interviews may be conducted over the telephone. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
interviewing procedures were disrupted, and during 2021, 61.4% of Sample Child interviews 
were conducted at least partially by telephone (5). For more information about NHIS, visit: 
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm. 
Point estimates and the corresponding confidence intervals were calculated using SAS-callable 
SUDAAN software (6). All estimates meet National Center for Health Statistics data presentation 
standards for proportions (7). Linear and quadratic trends and differences between percentages 
were evaluated using two-sided significance tests at the 0.05 level.
